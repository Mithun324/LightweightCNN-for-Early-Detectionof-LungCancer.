## üìù Overview

**LightweightCNN-for-Early-Detection-of-LungCancer** is a deep learning project built to provide **high accuracy** and **interpretability** for lung cancer detection.  
The system integrates explainable AI (XAI) methods with lightweight CNN architectures, optimized for scalability and real-world medical use.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Explainability:** Visualize model predictions with Class Activation Maps (CAM).  
- **High Accuracy:** Uses a lightweight CNN optimized for early lung cancer detection tasks.  
- **Modular Design:** Easy integration and scalability for updates or additional models.  
- **Python Framework:** Built with Python for seamless AI development.  
- **Robust Workflow:** Streamlined preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
